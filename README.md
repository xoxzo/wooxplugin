== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Does sms and voice behave the same?  
    Almost. For order cancel, and sms is send to admin when customer cancel, to customer when admin cancel. For voice, the default behave is always sending to admin.(Regardless who cancel).

2. How does customer cancel?  
    A cancel button will appear for each item in an order, when the order is in "pending payment" status. This is woocommerce behavior, under 'My Account' page.

3. Why does my cost of sending sms/voice is showing zero?  
    Refresh to see the updated status of each sms/voice call. This status is retrieved from Xoxzo telephony service.

4. Can I add sms/voice callback for any events in WooCommerce/WordPress?  
    Such functionality is not supported at the moment(Nor is recommended).

5. I enabled sms/voice for a particular events, but i don't see it under sms and voice status.  
    Try checking in 'Error Status' 

6. How does the cost of each sms/voice work?  
    Refer to Xoxzo pricing page
